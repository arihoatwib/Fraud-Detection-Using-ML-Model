# Fraud_Detection_Using_ML
Online Payment Fraud Detection using Machine Learning techniques and then Integrating it into the exisiting web based online payment systems.
With the proliferation of online payment systems, the convenience afforded to users has been paralleled by the rise of fraudulent activities. Traditional fraud detection methods, largely dependent on manual inspection and static rule-based systems, are proving insufficient against the evolving sophistication of fraud strategies. This study introduces a machine learning model tailored for the detection of online payment fraud. Utilizing advanced analytics, the model is designed to discern patterns and irregularities that signal fraudulent transactions, thereby bolstering security protocols and diminishing the occurrence of fraud. The proposed model aims for seamless integration with current payment infrastructures, delivering real-time fraud detection and immediate alert mechanisms.
